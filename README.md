# vmdb
A small-scale combination model of IMDb (Internet Movie Database) and Letterboxd for use at a personal level.

Android users can download the app.apk file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UfuUfNRjh2pi1KveIaMBktqHdCMGqX1F/view?usp=sharing). I had to discontinue the Firebase database, but the app still installs and shows the different functionalities.

## Features in VMDb:

User can input the following details of a film/ series:
- Name
- Director

- Cast (Leading Male Actor, Leading Female Actor, Supporting Male Actor, Supporting Female Actor)
- Year of Release
- Streaming Platform
- Status (the number of times you have watched the content)

User can edit the details by searching the database with the Name field.

User can query based on the following parameters: (querying based on multiple paramters is also supported)
- Name
