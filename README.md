# vmdb
A small-scale combination model of IMDb (Internet Movie Database) and Letterboxd for use at a personal level.

Android users can download the app.apk file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UfuUfNRjh2pi1KveIaMBktqHdCMGqX1F/view?usp=sharing). I had to discontinue the Firebase database, but the app still installs and shows the different functionalities.

## Features in VMDb:

User can input the following details of a film/ series:
- Name
- Director

- Cast (Leading Male Actor, Leading Female Actor, Supporting Male Actor, Supporting Female Actor)
- Year of Release
- Streaming Platform
- Status (the number of times you have watched the content)

User can edit the details by searching the database with the Name field.
